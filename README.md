### Suggested Repository Name
I recommend naming the repository **precalc-arena-shiny**. This is concise, descriptive (referencing the "Pre-Calculus Arena" theme in the app), and easy to share. You can create it on GitHub by going to github.com/new, entering the name, and initializing with a README.md file.

### Folder Structure
To set up the repo for easy deployment on shinyapps.io (note: it's shinyapps.io, not shiny.io—Shiny's hosting platform), use this simple structure:

```
precalc-arena-shiny/
├── app.R          # The single-file Shiny app code (copy the latest version from our conversation)
├── README.md      # The Markdown file with instructions and summary (content below)
└── .gitignore     # Optional: Ignore R-specific files like .Rhistory, .RData, etc.
```

- **No additional folders needed** since it's a single-file app. If you add images or data later, create an `assets/` folder.
- Upload `app.R` to the root.
- For deployment on shinyapps.io:
  1. Create a free account at [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/).
  2. Install the `rsconnect` package in R: `install.packages("rsconnect")`.
  3. Authenticate: Run `rsconnect::setAccountInfo(name='your-username', token='YOUR_TOKEN', secret='YOUR_SECRET')` (get token/secret from your shinyapps.io dashboard).
  4. Deploy from RStudio or console: `rsconnect::deployApp(appDir = "/path/to/precalc-arena-shiny")`.
  5. The app will be live at `https://your-username.shinyapps.io/precalc-arena-shiny/`.
  - Requirements: Ensure `shiny`, `bslib`, and `shinyWidgets` are installed (as in the app code). No other dependencies.

### README.md Content
Copy-paste the following into your repo's README.md file. It includes:
- A colorful shields.io badge for the app name.
- A clickable table of contents (using GitHub Markdown anchors).
- A summary of the game.
- The folder structure.
- Deployment instructions for shinyapps.io.

## Summary
Pre-Calculus Arena turns pre-calculus learning into an engaging RPG-style game. Players choose quests from topics like functions, polynomials, trigonometry, and limits. Complete missions to earn XP, build streaks for bonuses, level up, and unlock boss battles after finishing a quest's missions. Built as a single-file Shiny app in R, it's perfect for students, teachers, or math enthusiasts to practice interactively.

The app uses procedural generation for endless missions at Easy, Normal, or Hard difficulties, with hints and give-up options for stuck players. Track progress with stats like XP bar, level, streak, and quest completion.

## Features
- **Quests & Missions**: 7 pre-calculus topics with 6 missions each.
- **Gamification**: XP awards, levels (up to 100), streaks, and boss chains.
- **UI/UX**: Dark theme with Bootstrap, dynamic prompts, and feedback alerts.
- **Deployment Ready**: Runs locally or on shinyapps.io.

## Folder Structure
```
precalc-arena-shiny/
├── app.R          # Main Shiny app code (single file)
├── README.md      # This file with instructions
└── .gitignore     # Optional: Ignores R temp files
```

## How to Run Locally
1. Install required packages: `install.packages(c("shiny", "bslib", "shinyWidgets"))`.
2. Save the code as `app.R`.
3. Run in R/RStudio: `shiny::runApp()`.

## Deployment on ShinyApps.io
1. Sign up for a free account at [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/).
2. Install `rsconnect`: `install.packages("rsconnect")`.
3. Authenticate: Get your token/secret from the dashboard and run `rsconnect::setAccountInfo(name='your-username', token='YOUR_TOKEN', secret='YOUR_SECRET')`.
4. Deploy: `rsconnect::deployApp(appDir = "/path/to/repo")`.
5. Access the app at `https://your-username.shinyapps.io/precalc-arena-shiny/`.

### Next Steps
1. Create the repo on GitHub with the suggested name.
2. Add `app.R` (use the latest code from our conversation—ensure it's the fixed version).
3. Paste the README content into README.md and commit.
4. Share the repo URL with your friend (e.g., `https://github.com/your-username/precalc-arena-shiny`).
5. Optionally, add a LICENSE file (e.g., MIT) via GitHub's "Add file" button.

If you need adjustments to the README (e.g., more sections or a different badge color), let me know!
